# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns (Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends)
## Overview of the Project
An upcoming playwright Louise is interested in beginning a crowdfunding campaign to fund her upcoming play Fever. The project analyzes data from other crowdfunding campaigns to come up with trends that can help her make decisions about her own campaign.  

### Purpose
The purpose of the project is to determine various factors associated with crowdfunding that have made similar projects successful in the past. 
The project uses Excel to organize, sort and analyze the data which will be presented to the playwright Louise, to enable her to make decisions on how to best execute her campaign.

This chart for example shows that ‘Theater’ Kickstarter campaigns had the most successful campaigns in all categories in the United States, 

## Analysis and Challenges
The dataset used for analysis was huge and had different types of data including:
1. Text
2. Numerals
3. Currency
4. Dates

To ensure the final analysis was accurate, data had to be assessed to ensure it was classified correctly. 
Examples
*While assessing the Data before analysis, it was discovered that launch dates were set in Unix timestamps and needed to be converted. Using the dates as they were presented   originally would have led to errors in the analysis 
*Some formulas used resulted in errors.When calculating the average donations by backers, productions that  did not have backers returned an error because numbers cannot be divided by zero. Debugging errors on an ongoing basis is therefore crucial while working with data
different types of data including:

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
